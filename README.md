Student Platform for DBMS project

Our project is a platform which enables students from different branches to access their course materials , external refrences and get  notfications from the respective teachers as well as set reminders for themselves. 

A college has many departments, each department has its own department id and name . Every student belongs to a department ,sem, section and has a unique ssn, name, DOB, addr, phone number and gender. The admission number, parent details, class 10 and 12 marks, are also recorded.

A student is graded with a cgpa by the COE department. All the student above 6 CGPA are eligible for placements. Placement office records all the companies visiting the campus for placement and packages they offer . Based on the cut off  and eligibility criteria , student is allowed to sit for respective placement.

Every teacher has a unique id, name. Every department has a HOD(who is also a teacher). Every teacher updates resources which are links to associated videos and textbooks which can be accessed by the students. Every teacher handling the respective course in a class updates attendance which is recorded by the COE. If the attendance falls below 75% then the student is not eligible to write exam.
